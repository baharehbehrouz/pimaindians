Diabetes Dataset Analysis Using KNN Model
In this project, I analyzed the diabetes dataset and used IBM SPSS tool for statistical analysis and data processing. Then, I trained and tested the data using various models.

Data
The diabetes dataset includes medical information of patients, which has been utilized for analysis and processing in this project.

Analysis Approach
Data Preprocessing: In this stage, I preprocessed the data by handling missing or invalid values.
Statistical Analysis: Using IBM SPSS tool, I performed statistical analysis on the data to explore patterns and relationships.
Model Training: I experimented with different models including KNN, logistic regression, and decision trees to select the best model for predicting diabetes.
Model Evaluation: I evaluated the performance of the models using various metrics and achieved the best performance with the KNN model.
Results
Using the KNN model, I achieved an accuracy of 80% in predicting positive and negative cases of diabetes.
